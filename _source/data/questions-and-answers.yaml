  question: What is Feram?
  answer: |
    Feram is a Service which finds bugs in your merge requests
    and automatically generates patches for those bugs.
    You then can step through the patches and decide which ones
    you want to apply
    and they are automatically committed to your merge request.

  question: How does Feram work?
  answer: |
    Feram is a [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/feram)
    which seamlessly integrates in your GitHub merge request workflow.

    Every time a new merge request is opened, or new commits are pushed
    into an existing merge request Feram gets notified and
    automatically downloads the latest changes.
    It then uses state of the art open source tools to detect bugs in your code.
    (Check out the full list on our [features page](/features).)
    If any bugs were found we block the merge request and post a link
    to feram where you can select which patches you want
    to apply and which you want to discard.

    After making your selection we commit the relevant patches and
    push them onto your merge request branch.
    The merge request can then be merged.
