  question: What is Feram?
  answer: |
    Feram is a service which finds bugs in your merge requests
    and automatically generates patches for those bugs.
    Afterwards you can step through the patches and decide which ones
    you want to apply.
    Finally, the selected patches are committed to your merge request.

  question: How does Feram work?
  answer: |
    Feram is a [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/feram)
    which seamlessly integrates in your GitHub merge request workflow.

    Every time a new merge request is opened, or new commits are pushed
    into an existing merge request, Feram gets notified and
    automatically downloads the latest changes.
    It then uses state of the art open source tools to detect bugs in your code.
    (Check out the full list on our [features page](/features).)

    If any bugs were found Feram blocks the merge request and posts a link
    to the results of the code check.
    There you can select which patches you want to apply
    and which you want to discard.

    After making your selection Feram commits the relevant patches
    and pushes them onto your merge request branch.
    The merge request can then be merged.

    [getting started page](getting-started).

  question: Does Feram support GitLab and Bitbucket?
  answer: |
    The APIs of GitLab and Bitbucket are still inferior to GitHub's
    and they currently make it too hard for us to
    implement a great and seamless user experience.

    That said, if you are interested in an integration
    make sure to [contact us](/imprint).

  question: Why does Feram only check commits in merge requests?
  answer: |
    Currently, Feram needs to recheck the whole repository for every commit,
    because fixing just a subset of the code
    could lead to inconsistent repositories.

    As soon Feram supports incremental checks
    we will also enable checks for every commit!
