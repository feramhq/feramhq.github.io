  question: What is Feram?
  answer: |
    Feram is a Service which finds bugs in your merge requests
    and automatically generates patches for those bugs.
    You then can step through the patches and decide which ones
    you want to apply
    and they are automatically committed to your merge request.

  question: How does Feram work?
  answer: |
    Feram is a [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/feram)
    which seamlessly integrates in your GitHub merge request workflow.

    Every time a new merge request is opened, or new commits are pushed
    into an existing merge request Feram gets notified and
    automatically downloads the latest changes.
    It then uses state of the art open source tools to detect bugs in your code.
    (Check out the full list on our [features page](/features).)
    If any bugs were found we block the merge request and post a link
    to feram where you can select which patches you want
    to apply and which you want to discard.

    After making your selection we commit the relevant patches and
    push them onto your merge request branch.
    The merge request can then be merged.

    [getting started page](getting-started).

  question: Does Feram support GitLab and Bitbucket?
  answer: |
    The APIs of GitLab and Bitbucket are still inferior to GitHub's
    and they currently make it too expensive to
    implement a great and seamless user experience.

    If you are interested in an integration nevertheless
    make sure to [contact us](/imprint).

  question: Why does Feram only check commits in merge requests?
  answer: |
    Currently we need to recheck the whole repository for every commit,
    because fixing just a subset of the code
    could lead to inconsistet repositories.

    As soon as our capabilities have somewhat stabilized
    and we're confident we can handle the additional strain
    on our infrastructure, we're also going to provide checks for every commit!
